# healboard
Modified version of scoreboard to handle healing done parsing instead.

Primary uses:

//hd visible -- show/hide

//hd reset   -- resets parse


-- Known issues --

No reporting functionality, healing doesn't parse correctly for the Monberaux trust, and I never got around to including dread spikes.
